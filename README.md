# Geolocate Events 2024

This project focuses on the geolocation of events based on spatial and temporal information. The primary objective is to enhance raw event datasets by converting local timestamps to UTC, associating each event with its geographical elevation, and preparing the data for downstream environmental or geoscientific analyses.

The workflow involves:
- Extracting and standardizing time and location data.
- Determining accurate time zones using geographic coordinates.
- Fetching elevation data using digital elevation models.
- Outputting enriched event datasets with consistent geotemporal metadata.

This processing pipeline supports applications in environmental monitoring, atmospheric event tracking, and Earth system data science.
